This module allows a hierarchical configuration scheme with support for mappings
and sequences, cross-references between one part of the configuration and
another, the ability to flexibly access real Python objects without full-blown
eval(), an include facility, simple expression evaluation and the ability to
change, save, cascade and merge configurations. Interfaces easily with
environment variables and command-line options. It has been developed on python
2.3 but should work on version 2.2 or greater.
